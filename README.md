- 👋 Hi, I’m @brynhr

I'm a software engineer and engineering manager. I studied BSc CompSci at the University of Manchester, interning at Google before specialising in 3D graphics in my final year.
I moved to London to work for Microsoft on Paint 3D and Cortana AI, and since then have worked in FinTech and eCommerce. I've now been working in tech for 8+ years.
I moved into engineering management for the last 3 years, having had a great time helping people succeed. Currently I am a software engineer at Apple, working on their SLO platform.
- 👀 I’m interested in Golang, C#, Java, finance, AI, graphics and team leadership.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data engineering!
- 🛫 Outside of work, I love aviation and motorbikes!

I completed part of the [PPL]([url](https://www.caa.co.uk/general-aviation/pilot-licences/aeroplanes/private-pilot-licence-for-aeroplanes/)) training in my spare time. I've always loved aviation and hopefully one day I will finish my licence.
I also have a [Royal Enfield Bullet 500]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Bullet)) which I love!
I love learning new things. I deep dive into everything I'm passionate about, and I'm always looking for new hobbies and passions.

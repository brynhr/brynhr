- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @brynhr
I'm an engineering manager and software engineer from Manchester. I studied BSc CompSci at Manchester, interning at Google before specialising in 3D graphics in my final year.
I moved to London to work for Microsoft on Paint 3D and Cortana AI, and since then have worked in FinTech and eCommerce. I've now been working in tech for 7+ years.
I've moved into engineering management in the last 2+ years, having had a great time helping people succeed. Currently I am starting contract work after building up EM experience in a perm role.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in C#, Java, finance, AI, graphics and team leadership.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning energy tech!
- ðŸ›« Outside of work, I love aviation!
I completed part of the [PPL]([url](https://www.caa.co.uk/general-aviation/pilot-licences/aeroplanes/private-pilot-licence-for-aeroplanes/)) training in my spare time. I've always loved aviation and hopefully one day I will finish my licence.
I also hold a valid moped [CBT]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_Basic_Training)) and aim to complete my unrestricted motorbike licence in 2025.
I love learning new things. I deep dive into everything I'm passionate about, and I'm always looking for new hobbies and passions.
